## Code Structure

-   `describe_scene(source)`:  The main function that handles scene description.  It takes a `source` argument, which can be a file path (string) or a `cv2.VideoCapture` object. It returns a string containing the scene description or `None` if an error occurs. It calls the `_describe_video_feed` helper function to handle video inputs.
-   `_describe_video_feed(video_capture, is_live_feed)`: This helper function processes video feeds. It extracts frames from the `video_capture`, converts them to RGB, uses the image captioning pipeline to get a description, and optionally adds a timestamp for live feeds.  It returns a string containing the descriptions (with timestamps if applicable) or `None` on failure.

## Testing

To test the script:

1.  **Prepare test files:** Have a sample image file and a short video file available.

2.  **Modify the `__main__` block:** Update the `image_path` and `video_path` variables to point to your test files.

3.  **Run the script:** Observe the output and ensure that the descriptions generated are reasonable for the content of your test files.

4.  **(Optional) Test the live feed:** Uncomment the live feed section and run the script. Verify that it captures frames from your camera and generates descriptions with timestamps.

For more rigorous testing, you can consider creating a dedicated test suite using a testing framework like `pytest`. This would involve writing test functions that assert the expected behavior of the `describe_scene` function with different inputs and verifying that errors are handled correctly.
