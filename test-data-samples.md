    * **GitHub (Tiny-VIRAT, a smaller version):** [https://github.com/UgurDemir/Tiny-VIRAT](https://github.com/UgurDemir/Tiny-VIRAT)
    * (The main VIRAT dataset might require direct requests or be hosted on academic portals due to its size and nature.)

* **MEVA Dataset:**
    * **Official Website:** [https://mevadata.org/](https://mevadata.org/) (This site typically contains information on how to access the dataset.)
    * **CVF Open Access (paper describing the dataset):** [https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/papers/Corona_MEVA_A_Large-Scale_Multiview_Multimodal_Video_Dataset_for_Activity_Detection_WACV_2021_paper.pdf](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/papers/Corona_MEVA_A_Large-Scale_Multiview_Multimodal_Video_Dataset_for_Activity_Detection_WACV_2021_paper.pdf)

Remember that for very large datasets like Kinetics, you often need to check their specific download instructions, which might involve using Google Cloud Storage or similar services, and sometimes require academic affiliation.
